    "**1. What is multithreading in Python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in Python.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multithreading** in Python is the ability to run multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently within a single process. Each thread runs in the same memory space, allowing shared access to variables and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it used?**\n",
    "- **Concurrency**: It allows multiple operations to be performed simultaneously, improving the efficiency of programs, especially for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "- **Responsiveness**: It makes applications more responsive by performing background operations without freezing the main program.\n",
    "- **Resource Sharing**: Threads can share resources and data more easily compared to processes, which can be beneficial for certain types of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module used to handle threads in Python is the `threading` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Why is the `threading` module used? Write the use of the following functions (activeCount, currentThread, enumerate).**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `threading` module is used to create, control, and manage threads in Python. It provides a higher-level interface for working with threads compared to the low-level `_thread` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `threading.activeCount()`: Returns the number of Thread objects currently alive.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import threading\n",
    "  print(\"Active threads:\", threading.activeCount())\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `threading.currentThread()`: Returns the current Thread object corresponding to the caller's thread of control.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import threading\n",
    "  print(\"Current thread:\", threading.currentThread().getName())\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `threading.enumerate()`: Returns a list of all Thread objects currently alive.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import threading\n",
    "  print(\"All active threads:\", threading.enumerate())\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Explain the following functions (run, start, join, isAlive).**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `run`: The `run` method defines the thread's activity and is called when the thread starts. You typically override this method when creating a subclass of `Thread`.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "  class MyThread(threading.Thread):\n",
    "      def run(self):\n",
    "          print(\"Thread is running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "  my_thread = MyThread()\n",
    "  my_thread.run()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `start`: The `start` method initiates a thread's activity by invoking the `run` method in a separate thread of control.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "  class MyThread(threading.Thread):\n",
    "      def run(self):\n",
    "          print(\"Thread is running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "  my_thread = MyThread()\n",
    "  my_thread.start()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `join`: The `join` method waits for the thread to complete its execution. It blocks the calling thread until the thread whose `join` method is called terminates.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "  class MyThread(threading.Thread):\n",
    "      def run(self):\n",
    "          print(\"Thread is running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "  my_thread = MyThread()\n",
    "  my_thread.start()\n",
    "  my_thread.join()\n",
    "  print(\"Thread has finished\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `isAlive`: The `isAlive` method returns whether the thread is still running.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "  class MyThread(threading.Thread):\n",
    "      def run(self):\n",
    "          import time\n",
    "          time.sleep(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "  my_thread = MyThread()\n",
    "  my_thread.start()\n",
    "  print(\"Is thread alive?\", my_thread.isAlive())\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Write a Python program to create two threads. Thread one must print the list of squares and thread two must print the list of cubes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_squares():\n",
    "    squares = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, 11)]\n",
    "    print(\"Squares:\", squares)\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_cubes():\n",
    "    cubes = [i ** 3 for i in range(1, 11)]\n",
    "    print(\"Cubes:\", cubes)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create threads\n",
    "thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_squares)\n",
    "thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_cubes)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start threads\n",
    "thread1.start()\n",
    "thread2.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait for threads to complete\n",
    "thread1.join()\n",
    "thread2.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Both threads have finished execution\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Improved Performance**: Better performance for I/O-bound and high-latency tasks.\n",
    "- **Resource Sharing**: Threads share the same memory space, facilitating easier communication and data sharing.\n",
    "- **Responsiveness**: Improved application responsiveness, especially in GUI applications.\n",
    "- **Efficient Utilization**: Efficient utilization of system resources for concurrent tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- **GIL Limitation**: In CPython, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallel execution of threads, making multithreading less effective for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Increased complexity in writing and maintaining thread-safe code.\n",
    "- **Debugging Difficulty**: Harder to debug and reproduce issues such as race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "- **Overhead**: Context switching between threads can introduce overhead, potentially negating performance gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadlocks:**\n",
    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a resource. Deadlocks typically occur when threads have circular dependencies on resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "lock1 = threading.Lock()\n",
    "lock2 = threading.Lock()\n",
    "\n",
    "def thread1_routine():\n",
    "    lock1.acquire()\n",
    "    print(\"Thread 1 acquired lock 1\")\n",
    "    lock2.acquire()\n",
    "    print(\"Thread 1 acquired lock 2\")\n",
    "    lock2.release()\n",
    "    lock1.release()\n",
    "\n",
    "def thread2_routine():\n",
    "    lock2.acquire()\n",
    "    print(\"Thread 2 acquired lock 2\")\n",
    "    lock1.acquire()\n",
    "    print(\"Thread 2 acquired lock 1\")\n",
    "    lock1.release()\n",
    "    lock2.release()\n",
    "\n",
    "thread1 = threading.Thread(target=thread1_routine)\n",
    "thread2 = threading.Thread(target=thread2_routine)\n",
    "thread1.start()\n",
    "thread2.start()\n",
    "thread1.join()\n",
    "thread2.join()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Race Conditions:**\n",
    "A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing of events (such as thread execution order), leading to unpredictable results. Race conditions typically occur when multiple threads access and modify shared resources concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "shared_counter = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "def increment():\n",
    "    global shared_counter\n",
    "    for _ in range(100000):\n",
    "        shared_counter += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "thread1 = threading.Thread(target=increment)\n",
    "thread2 = threading.Thread(target=increment)\n",
    "\n",
    "thread1.start()\n",
    "thread2.start()\n",
    "thread1.join()\n",
    "thread2.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Shared counter value:\", shared_counter)  # Output may vary\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the final value of `shared_counter` can vary because the threads may interleave in different ways, leading to inconsistent updates. Proper synchronization (e.g., using locks) is required to avoid such issues.\n",

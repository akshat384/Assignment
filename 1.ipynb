    "**Q1. What is an Exception in Python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. It is a signal that indicates that something unexpected or erroneous has happened. Exceptions can be caused by a variety of reasons such as invalid input, file not found, network issues, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is:\n",
    "- **Exceptions**: Occur during the execution of a program when something goes wrong (e.g., division by zero, accessing a non-existent file).\n",
    "- **Syntax errors**: Occur during the parsing of code before execution and are typically caused by errors in the syntax of the code (e.g., missing colons, incorrect indentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is not handled (i.e., there is no code to catch and respond to the exception), the program will terminate abruptly, and an error message will be displayed. This can make the program fail in an unpredictable manner. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of an unhandled exception\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = 10 / 0  # Division by zero will raise an exception\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught an exception:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the division by zero will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` exception. If there's no `except` block to handle this exception, the program will crash with an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. Which Python statements are used to catch and handle exceptions? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `try`, `except`, `finally`, and optionally `else` statements are used to catch and handle exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **try**: This block is used to enclose the code that might raise an exception.\n",
    "- **except**: This block is used to handle the exception if it occurs.\n",
    "- **finally**: This block is used to execute code whether an exception occurs or not.\n",
    "- **else**: This block is executed if no exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Division successful\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"Execution completed\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, since the division by zero raises an exception, the `except` block is executed to handle it. The `finally` block is always executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Explain with an example: try, except, else, finally, and raise.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example demonstrating the use of `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`, and `raise`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    if num <= 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Number must be greater than zero\")\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input:\", e)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Input is valid\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"Execution completed\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `try`: Attempts to get user input and convert it to an integer.\n",
    "- `except`: Handles `ValueError` if the input cannot be converted to an integer or doesn't meet the condition.\n",
    "- `else`: Prints a message if input is valid.\n",
    "- `finally`: Ensures that the final message is always printed, indicating completion of execution.\n",
    "- `raise`: Raises a `ValueError` if the input number is less than or equal to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. What are Custom Exceptions in Python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom exceptions in Python are user-defined exceptions that extend the base `Exception` class. They allow you to create specialized exceptions that can be raised and caught in your code, providing better error handling and clarity in specific situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need custom exceptions to distinguish between different types of errors in our code and handle them appropriately. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Custom exception class\n",
    "class ValueTooSmallError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message=\"Value is too small\"):\n",
    "        self.message = message\n",
    "        super().__init__(self.message)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the custom exception\n",
    "def validate(num):\n",
    "    if num <= 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueTooSmallError(\"Number must be greater than zero\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    validate(-5)\n",
    "except ValueTooSmallError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `ValueTooSmallError` is a custom exception class that inherits from Python's built-in `Exception` class. It allows us to raise an exception with a specific message when a condition (number less than or equal to zero) is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. Create a custom exception class. Use this class to handle an exception.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure, here's an example of creating and using a custom exception class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Custom exception class\n",
    "class FileFormatError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message=\"Invalid file format\"):\n",
    "        self.message = message\n",
    "        super().__init__(self.message)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function using the custom exception\n",
    "def process_file(file_name):\n",
    "    if not file_name.endswith('.txt'):\n",
    "        raise FileFormatError(\"File must be a text file\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    process_file(\"data.csv\")\n",
    "except FileFormatError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `FileFormatError` is a custom exception class used to handle cases where a file format other than `.txt` is encountered. When `process_file` is called with `\"data.csv\"`, it raises a `FileFormatError`, which is caught and handled in the `except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to ask if you have any more questions or if there's anything else you'd like to learn about exceptions in Python!It seems like your message got a bit garbled. It looks like you're asking several questions about exceptions in Python. Let's clarify and address each question:\n",

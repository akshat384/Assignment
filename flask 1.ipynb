    "### Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flask** is a lightweight web framework written in Python. It is classified as a \"micro-framework\" because it doesn't require any specific tools or libraries and is minimalistic in nature, which allows developers flexibility in how they want to structure their web applications. Flask is easy to set up and allows for rapid development, making it popular for smaller projects, prototyping, and for developers who need control over how they build applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Flask Framework:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lightweight and Flexible**: Flask is a micro-framework and does not have built-in tools or form validation, giving developers full control.\n",
    "2. **Easy to Learn**: Flask has a simple syntax and modular design, making it suitable for beginners.\n",
    "3. **Extensible**: Extensions are available for adding additional functionality, such as handling forms, authentication, and database access.\n",
    "4. **Integrated Development Server**: Flask comes with a development server, allowing for easier debugging and testing.\n",
    "5. **Good Documentation**: Flask is well-documented and has an active community, so finding resources and help is easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Create a simple Flask application to display ‘Hello World!!’\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a simple Flask application, you can use the following code in a Jupyter Notebook cell. First, ensure Flask is installed by running `!pip install flask`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import the Flask module\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the Flask application\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a route for the default URL\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def hello():\n",
    "    return \"Hello World!!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the app\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute and see the output in Jupyter Notebook, you would need to run the Flask app in a separate cell or terminal, then open the provided URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`). Unfortunately, Jupyter doesn't natively support running web apps directly within a notebook interface. You can, however, display the output by running the app in a terminal window or using `flask run`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What is App Routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "**App routing** in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs to functions in the application. The decorator `@app.route()` binds a URL endpoint to a specific function. When a user accesses a specific URL, Flask knows which function to execute based on these routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasons for Using App Routes:**\n",
    "1. **Organize Application Logic**: Each route points to a different function, allowing for clear separation of application components.\n",
    "2. **URL Mapping**: Routing allows you to control which URL points to which function, simplifying navigation within the app.\n",
    "3. **Easy URL Customization**: Routes can be customized for intuitive URLs, improving user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Create a “/welcome” route and a “/” route\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the Flask application code for both routes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import the Flask module\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the Flask application\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Route for the welcome message\n",
    "@app.route('/welcome')\n",
    "def welcome():\n",
    "    return \"Welcome to ABC Corporation\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Route for company details\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def company_details():\n",
    "    return \"\"\"\n",
    "    <h1>Company Name: ABC Corporation</h1>\n",
    "    <h2>Location: India</h2>\n",
    "    <h2>Contact Detail: 999-999-9999</h2>\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the app\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view the outputs for each route by accessing:\n",
    "- `http://127.0.0.1:5000/welcome` for the welcome message.\n",
    "- `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` for the company details.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. What function is used in Flask for URL Building? Demonstration of `url_for()`\n",
    "\n",
    "In Flask, the `url_for()` function is used for URL building. It generates the URL for a specified function by taking the function name as an argument. This is helpful when we want to avoid hardcoding URLs and instead use a dynamic reference, making code maintenance easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import required modules\n",
    "from flask import Flask, url_for\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the Flask application\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a function and route\n",
    "@app.route('/about')\n",
    "def about():\n",
    "    return \"This is the About Page\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the home route\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    # Use url_for() to generate the URL for the about function\n",
    "    about_url = url_for('about')\n",
    "    return f\"The About page can be found at: {about_url}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the app\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you access `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, the output will display the dynamically generated link for the “about” page."

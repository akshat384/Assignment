    "**Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MongoDB:** MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which allows for dynamic schemas. It is designed for scalability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-Relational Databases:** These databases do not use a fixed schema for data storage. They are optimized for specific use cases such as large-scale data, unstructured data, and rapid development cycles. Types include document stores (e.g., MongoDB), key-value stores (e.g., Redis), wide-column stores (e.g., Cassandra), and graph databases (e.g., Neo4j).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenarios for MongoDB Over SQL Databases:**\n",
    "  - **Dynamic Schema:** When the data structure can change over time or is not well-defined.\n",
    "  - **Scalability:** When horizontal scaling is needed to handle large volumes of data.\n",
    "  - **Unstructured Data:** When storing unstructured or semi-structured data like JSON, XML, etc.\n",
    "  - **Performance:** For applications requiring fast read and write operations.\n",
    "  - **Rapid Development:** For agile development where schema changes are frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Schema-less:** MongoDB allows storing documents of different structures in the same collection.\n",
    "- **Document-Oriented:** Stores data in JSON-like BSON format.\n",
    "- **High Performance:** Optimized for read/write operations.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Supports horizontal scaling via sharding.\n",
    "- **Indexing:** Supports various indexing options to optimize query performance.\n",
    "- **Replication:** Provides high availability and data redundancy via replica sets.\n",
    "- **Aggregation Framework:** Allows performing complex data analysis operations.\n",
    "- **Flexible:** Adapts easily to changes in data model and application requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to MongoDB\n",
    "client = MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a database\n",
    "db = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a collection\n",
    "collection = db[\"mycollection\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Database and Collection created successfully!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Using the database and the collection created in question number 3, write a code to insert one record, and insert many records. Use the find() and find_one() methods to print the inserted record.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Insert one record\n",
    "one_record = {\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n",
    "collection.insert_one(one_record)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert many records\n",
    "many_records = [\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Jane Doe\", \"age\": 25, \"city\": \"Chicago\"},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 27, \"city\": \"Los Angeles\"},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 32, \"city\": \"San Francisco\"}\n",
    "]\n",
    "collection.insert_many(many_records)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find one record\n",

    "for record in collection.find():\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to demonstrate this.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **find():** The `find()` method is used to retrieve documents from a collection that match a given query.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Query to find records where age is greater than 25\n",
    "query = {\"age\": {\"$gt\": 25}}\n",

    "    print(record)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sort():** The `sort()` method is used to sort the results of a query in ascending or descending order based on one or more fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sort the records by age in ascending order\n",
    "sorted_records = collection.find().sort(\"age\", 1)\n",

    "for record in sorted_records:\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **delete_one():** Deletes a single document that matches the given filter. If multiple documents match, only the first one found is deleted.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  collection.delete_one({\"name\": \"John Doe\"})\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",

    "  collection.delete_many({\"age\": {\"$gt\": 30}})\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",

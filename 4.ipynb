    "**Q1. What is multiprocessing in Python? Why is it useful?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability to run multiple processes simultaneously, leveraging multiple CPU cores. It is part of the `multiprocessing` module which allows the creation of processes, communication between processes, and synchronization. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it useful?**\n",
    "- **Performance Improvement**: By utilizing multiple CPU cores, it can significantly speed up computation-heavy tasks.\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Each process runs in its own memory space, which provides better isolation and stability.\n",
    "- **Bypassing GIL**: The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python restricts the execution of multiple threads in the same process. Multiprocessing bypasses this limitation as each process has its own Python interpreter and memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?**\n",

    "**Q3. Write a Python code to create a process using the `multiprocessing` module.**\n",
    "\n",

    "**Q4. What is a multiprocessing pool in Python? Why is it used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A multiprocessing pool in Python is a collection of worker processes that can execute tasks in parallel. The `Pool` class in the `multiprocessing` module provides a convenient way to manage multiple worker processes and distribute tasks among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it used?**\n",
    "- **Simplified Parallelism**: It simplifies the process of parallelizing tasks by managing a pool of worker processes.\n",
    "- **Load Balancing**: It automatically distributes the workload among the available processes.\n",
    "- **Efficient Resource Usage**: By reusing worker processes, it minimizes the overhead of process creation and termination.\n",

    "- We ensure that the main program waits for all processes to complete by calling `join` on each process."

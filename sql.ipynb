    "**Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database:** A database is an organized collection of data, typically stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. It uses a structure that allows efficient retrieval, insertion, and management of data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **SQL (Relational) Databases:**\n",
    "  - SQL (Structured Query Language) databases store data in tables with predefined schemas. They are relational in nature, meaning they emphasize relationships between tables.\n",
    "  - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NoSQL (Non-Relational) Databases:**\n",
    "  - NoSQL databases store data in a schema-less way, often using documents, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graphs.\n",
    "  - They are designed for flexibility, scalability, and high performance.\n",
    "  - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DDL (Data Definition Language):** DDL is a subset of SQL used to define and modify the structure of database objects.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **CREATE:** Used to create new database objects like tables, indexes, views, etc.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "        id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "        name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "        salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    "    );\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **DROP:** Used to delete existing database objects like tables, indexes, views, etc.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **ALTER:** Used to modify the structure of existing database objects.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **TRUNCATE:** Used to remove all records from a table while keeping its structure intact.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** DML is used for manipulating data within database objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **INSERT:** Used to add new records into a table.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000);\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **UPDATE:** Used to modify existing records in a table.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    UPDATE employees SET salary = 55000 WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **DELETE:** Used to remove records from a table.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DQL (Data Query Language):** DQL is used to retrieve data from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **SELECT:** Used to fetch data from one or more tables.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT';\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Key:** A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It must contain unique values and cannot have NULL values.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Foreign Key:** A foreign key is a column or a group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. It establishes a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. Write a Python code to connect MySQL to Python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establishing a connection to MySQL\n",
    "mydb = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "  host=\"localhost\",\n",
    "  user=\"yourusername\",\n",
    "  password=\"yourpassword\",\n",
    "  database=\"yourdatabase\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a cursor object using cursor() method\n",
    "mycursor = mydb.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using execute() method to perform SQL queries\n",
    "mycursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM employees\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetching data using fetchall() method\n",
    "for x in mycursor.fetchall():\n",
    "  print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Closing the cursor and database connection\n",
    "mycursor.close()\n",
    "mydb.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **cursor():** The `cursor()` method creates a cursor object which is used to execute SQL queries on a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **execute():** The `execute()` method is used to execute SQL queries on the database through the cursor object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical order of SQL clauses in a SELECT query is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SELECT:** Specifies the columns to retrieve data from.\n",
    "2. **FROM:** Specifies the tables from which to retrieve data.\n",
    "3. **WHERE:** Applies conditions to filter rows based on specified criteria.\n",
    "4. **GROUP BY:** Groups rows sharing a property into summary rows.\n",
    "5. **HAVING:** Applies conditions to grouped rows.\n",
    "6. **ORDER BY:** Specifies the order of the result set based on columns.\n",
    "7. **LIMIT/OFFSET:** Limits the number of rows returned or skips a number of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "These clauses can vary slightly depending on the specific SQL dialect being used, but this is the general order followed in most SQL queries."

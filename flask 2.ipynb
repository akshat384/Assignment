    "Here are the answers to your questions on Flaskâ€™s HTTP methods, requests, redirection, templates, and API creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1. Explain GET and POST methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GET** and **POST** are two of the most commonly used HTTP methods in web applications. They determine how data is requested and transmitted between a client and a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GET Method**:\n",
    "   - The GET method is used to request data from a server.\n",
    "   - It is commonly used to retrieve information from the server without modifying it.\n",
    "   - Data sent through GET is appended to the URL as query parameters, making it visible in the browser's address bar.\n",
    "   - GET requests are cacheable and ideal for reading data or fetching resources.\n",
    "   - Example use: `GET /products?category=books`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **POST Method**:\n",
    "   - The POST method is used to send data to the server, often to submit or upload information.\n",
    "   - Data sent with POST is included in the request body, making it more secure than GET for sensitive information.\n",
    "   - POST requests are non-idempotent, meaning they can produce different outcomes on each request.\n",
    "   - Example use: `POST /register` with form data like username and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Why is `request` used in Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`request`** object in Flask is used to access incoming request data. When a client sends data to the server via GET, POST, or other HTTP methods, `request` allows the server to read and interact with this data. It can capture information like form data, JSON payloads, headers, and file uploads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Common Uses of `request`**:\n",
    "   - Accessing form data (e.g., `request.form`).\n",
    "   - Parsing JSON data from a request (e.g., `request.get_json()`).\n",
    "   - Reading request parameters (e.g., `request.args` for query parameters).\n",
    "   - Handling file uploads (e.g., `request.files`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. Why is `redirect()` used in Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`redirect()`** function in Flask is used to redirect the user to a different URL. It returns a response to the client instructing the browser to load a new page. `redirect()` is helpful when:\n",
    "   - We need to navigate the user to a different page after completing an action (e.g., after form submission).\n",
    "   - Implementing URL redirection for resources that have moved or have new endpoints.\n",
    "   - Creating a user-friendly experience by guiding users to specific routes after login or logout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return \"Home Page\"\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/login')\n",
    "def login():\n",
    "    # Redirect to the home page after login\n",
    "    return redirect(url_for('home'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What are templates in Flask? Why is the `render_template()` function used?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Templates** in Flask are HTML files that serve as the visual structure of a web page. Templates allow you to separate the presentation layer from the logic layer, enabling you to use HTML with embedded placeholders that are dynamically replaced with data from the backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`render_template()` Function**:\n",
    "   - The `render_template()` function in Flask loads an HTML template and renders it with dynamic data passed from the Flask application.\n",
    "   - It enables us to use templating engines like Jinja2, allowing for dynamic content generation.\n",
    "   - Example usage: `render_template(\"home.html\", title=\"Welcome Page\", user_name=\"John\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of `render_template()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, render_template\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return render_template(\"home.html\", title=\"Home Page\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Create a simple API and test it with Postman\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple Flask API that accepts POST requests to create a user and GET requests to retrieve the created user.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "# In-memory storage for user data\n",
    "users = []\n",
    "\n",
    "# Route to create a new user\n",
    "@app.route('/create_user', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def create_user():\n",
    "    data = request.get_json()  # Retrieve JSON data from request\n",
    "    users.append(data)  # Add data to users list\n",
    "    return jsonify({\"message\": \"User created successfully\", \"data\": data}), 201\n",
    "\n",
    "# Route to retrieve all users\n",
    "@app.route('/users', methods=['GET'])\n",
    "def get_users():\n",
    "    return jsonify(users)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the app\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this API in **Postman**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start the Flask app.\n",
    "2. In Postman, use `POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/create_user` with a JSON body:\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   {\n",
    "      \"name\": \"Alice\",\n",
    "      \"age\": 30\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - You should see a success message and the user data returned in the response.\n",
    "3. To retrieve users, send a `GET` request to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/users`.\n",
    "   - This will display all users created.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running these tests, you can take screenshots of the Postman results to document the API functionality."
